# Readable and Writable Flags Register



### Control Line Assignment
This project continues to use the control logic design introduced in the [8-Bit Instruction Register project](../instruction-register-8-bit/), however the control line assignments are redone some. The control line assignments are:

| Control Line Position | Bank | Group | Symbol | Notes |
|:-:|:--|:--|:-:|:--|
|1 | Left | Direct | `HILO` | Indicates which byte of a 16-bit register is being operated on |
|2 | Left | Direct | `PCa` | Write program counter value to address bus |
|3 | Left | Direct | `ARa` | Write memory address register value to address bus |
|4 | Left | Direct | `SPa` | Stack pointer address activate |
|5 | Left | Direct | `HLa` | `HL` register address activate |
|6 | Left | Direct | `AOa` | Write Address Offset results to address bus adder |
|7 | Left | Direct | `Fi` | Read data bus into Flags (`F`) register |
|8 | Left | Direct | `AOi` | Address Offset register in from data bus |
|9 | Left | Direct | `PCi` | Read data bus value into single program counter byte indicated by `HILO`, or address bus value if `DSs` is selected |
|10 | Left | Direct | `IRi` | Read data bus value into instruction register |
|11 | Left | High | `MDi` | Memory device read from data bus |
|12 | Left | High | `Ai` | Read data bus value into `A` register |
|13 | Left | High | `Ti` | Read data bus value into temp register |
|14 | Left | High | `HLi` | Read data bus value into single `HL` register byte indicated by `HILO` |
|15 | Left | High | `Ii` | Read data bus value into `I` register |
|16 | Left | High | `Ji` | Read data bus value into `J` register |
|17 | Left | High | `ARi` | Read data bus value into single memory address register byte indicated by `HILO` |
|18 | Left | Low | `PCe` | Activate program counter increment |
|19 | Left | Low | `ARe` | Activate memory address register increment |
|20 | Left | Low |  `SPe` | Increments stack pointer value,  or decrements when `SUB` is active |
|21 | Left | Low | `Ie` | Activate register `I` increment, or decrement when `SUB` is active  |
|22 | Left | Low | `Je` | Activate register `J` increment, or decrement when `SUB` is active |
|23 | Left | Low |  `HLe` | `HL` register increment enable |
|24 | Left | Low | |  *unused* |
|25 | Right | Direct | `SUB` | Indicates whether the increment operation should instead be a decrement operation |
|26 | Right | Direct | `CRY` | Use carry flag to ALU operation |
|27 | Right | Direct | `S0` | ALU control bit `S0` |
|28 | Right | Direct | `S1` | ALU control bit `S1` |
|29 | Right | Direct | `S2` | ALU control bit `S2` |
|30 | Right | Direct | `S3` | ALU control bit `S3` |
|31 | Right | Direct |  | **Reserved:** `INTr` (reset interrupt status) |
|32 | Right | Direct |  | **Reserved:** `INTi` (load interrupt status) |
|33 | Right | Direct | `AP1` | Add 1 to value on address bus |
|34 | Right | Direct | `ABo` | Write the byte indicated by `HILO` of the address bus to the data bus |
|35 | Right | High | `MDo` | Memory device output to data bus |
|36 | Right | High | `Ao` | Write contents of `A` register to data bus |
|37 | Right | High | `To` | Write at the temp register to the data bus |
|38 | Right | High | `Fo` | Writes the Flags register to the data bus |
|39 | Right | High | `Io` | Write contents of `I` register to data bus |
|40 | Right | High | `Jo` | Write contents of `J` register to data bus |
|41 | Right | High | `âˆ‘o` | Write the results of the ALU operation to data bus |
|42 | Right | Low | `SCr` | Resets both the step counter and the extended instruction bit. A step counter overflow needs to do the same thing. |
|43 | Right | Low |  `SPr` | Reset stack pointer to "empty stack" value |
|44 | Right | Low |  `DSs` | Data source input select for 16-bit registers that can load from either address or data bus. LOW is data bus, HIGH is address bus. |
|45 | Right | Low | `CMPs` | Write the temp register to the comparison unit |
|46 | Right | Low | | *unused* |
|47 | Right | Low |  `XTD` | Activate extended instruction bit and resets the step counter. |
|48 | Right | Low | `HLT` | Halt the system clock |

The significant changes over the last project are:
